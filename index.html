Our primary focus is improving the sense of community in ECE. In order to achive this we will maintain existing social events and introduce new ones.</p>

      <p>
        I am currently in my 4th year at UBC and am in my 3rd year standing as an Electrical Engineering Student. While at UBC I have been involved with, and held leadership positions in many extracurricular activities. I was involved in Engineers without Borders from 2019-2021 where I led the free tutoring initiative
        for high school students during the summer of 2020. I was later involved in SUBC, UBC's Human Powered Submarine design team, where I led the electrical subteam. Most recently, I have been involved as a bar rep and keeper of the cairn for the EUS. 
        I was also very involved in E-Week this year and attended many events. I was one of the two elec students who spearheaded the ECE ball model which placed second this year and which used voice recognition to pour drinks when requested.

  <h3 class="w3-center">Our Platform</h3>
  <p class="w3-center">
    As your VP Student-Life representatives our first priority will be improving the sense of belonging and community within ECE. In our experience, the best way to build a vibrant community is through social programming tailored to everyone's interests.
    We understand that the ECE community is filled with people from diverse backgrounds, and we want everyone to feel that they can participate in ECE events. Whatever your lifestyle we want to have events suited for you!
  </p><br>
  <p class="w3-center">
    For those of you who want to <strong>party</strong>, we plan to host at least <strong>one ESC party per term!</strong> Cheap drinks, good company, what's not to love? These new parties would be in addition to established social events such as our end of year ball (Lightning Ball) and our end of year bonfire (Touch Grass).
  </p><br>
  <p class="w3-center">
    For our <strong>athletes</strong>, we want to provide opportunities to stay fit while meeting members of the ECE community. As your student life representatives we would help connect you with fellow athletes in ECE in order to facilitate the creation of ECE intramural teams for the UBC REC leagues. Additionally,
    we would host a ski/board trip for people of all skill levels to have a fun day in the snow!
  </p><br>
  <p class="w3-center">
    For our <strong>trivia lovers</strong>, wouldn't it be great to see ECE win the EUS Genius Bowl and the trivia event at E-Week next year? We want you to be as prepared as possible for these big events! We will organize ECE teams to partake in every EUS trivia event, and will get groups together on a monthly basis to participate in local bar trivia.
    Think trips to Good-Co for monday trivia with your friends from ECE! 
  </p><br>
  <p class="w3-center">
    For those of you <strong>who just want some free food</strong>. We've got you covered as well! We plan to continue the Monkey Mondays initiative started by Eve this year as well as hosting bi-weekly movie and pizza nights!
  </p><br>
  <p class="w3-center">
    Finally, wouldn't it be awesome to see <strong>ECE WIN E-WEEK NEXT YEAR???</strong> E-Week is the best week of the year, and it is a fantastic opportunity for you to meet members of the ECE community who are also involved in student life on campus.
    After our strong performance this year, having placed fifth overall with podium finishes in multiple events, we believe that ECE has a very feasible chance at the crown next year. In order to realize our ambitions for victory next year, we will begin preparations for E-Week in first term.
    We will organize students into groups to start planning for the more time consuming projects early in first term. Imagine the possibilities for our Ball Model and FilmFeust entries next year if given the time to prepare!
